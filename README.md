# Interactive Plot Generator with Pandas Bot

This Streamlit application allows users to upload a CSV file and generate various interactive plots using Plotly. Additionally, users can interact with a basic Pandas bot to perform common DataFrame operations.

## Features

1. **CSV File Upload**: Users can upload a CSV file to the application.
2. **Interactive Plots**: Generate Scatter Plot, Bar Plot, Box Plot, and Histogram based on the uploaded data.
3. **Pandas Bot**: Perform basic DataFrame operations such as describe, head, tail, and sample.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- Plotly

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the code.
2. Install the required packages using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install streamlit pandas plotly
    ```

## Usage

1. Navigate to the directory containing the code.
2. Run the Streamlit application:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
3. Open the provided URL in a web browser.
4. Upload a CSV file using the "Upload CSV file" button.
5. Select the type of plot you want to generate from the dropdown menu.
6. Choose the appropriate columns for the selected plot type.
7. View the generated plot.
8. Interact with the Pandas bot to perform basic DataFrame operations.

## Code Overview

### Functions

- **read_csv_from_input()**: Handles the file upload and reads the CSV into a DataFrame.
- **generate_scatter_plot(df, x_col, y_col)**: Generates a scatter plot using Plotly.
- **generate_bar_plot(df, x_col, y_col)**: Generates a bar plot using Plotly.
- **generate_box_plot(df, x_col, y_col)**: Generates a box plot using Plotly.
- **generate_histogram(df, column)**: Generates a histogram using Plotly.
- **chatbot_operations(df)**: Provides a simple interface to perform common Pandas operations like describe, head, tail, and sample.
- **main()**: The main function that ties all components together and runs the Streamlit application.

### Flow

1. The user uploads a CSV file.
2. The application reads the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
3. The user selects the type of plot and the columns to be plotted.
4. The application generates the plot and displays it.
5. The user can interact with the Pandas bot to perform common DataFrame operations.

## Example

1. Start the application:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
2. Upload a CSV file containing data.
3. Select "Scatter Plot" from the plot type dropdown.
4. Choose columns for the x-axis and y-axis.
5. View the scatter plot generated from the data.
6. Use the Pandas bot to describe the DataFrame.
